R scripts and tutorials for the core Biology labs at Bucknell

The computers in Biology Rooms 108 and 110 already have R and RStudio installed.
If you are working on a different computer (such as your own) you will need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Get R
  http://cran.rstudio.com/

Step 2: Install RStudio
  http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
  
Once R and RStudio have been installed, launch the RStudio software and use it to open one of the R scripts (.R) files from this repository.
